# Dissecting glial scar formation by spatial point pattern and topological data analysis - Github Repository

This repository is linked to the article "Dissecting glial scar formation by spatial point pattern and topological data analysis" published in XXX (DOI: LINK). If you our approximation and code valuable, we kindly ask you to cite the article mentioned above.

## Description

In this research, we conducted Point Pattern Analysis (PPA) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in microscopy brain images derived from ischemic animals (MCAO model) at different time points. We focused on analyzing the arrangement of Gfap and Iba1-expressing cells forming the glial scar in the injury core. This repository aims to make fully reproducible the analysis presented in the original research article.
